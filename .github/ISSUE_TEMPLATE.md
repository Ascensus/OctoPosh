Thanks for taking the time to log an issue.

However, I want the backlog to reflect things I'm committed to add/fix in the future. So when you reach the Project's Issues page, you wont have to swim through tons of issues created by many users, but instead only of things that you know are going to happen.

If you've found a bug or you want to propose an enhancement, please [reach out at Gitter](https://gitter.im/Dalmirog/OctoPosh#initial) instead. I'm monitoring that chat pretty often.

**Yes**, this is totally a rip off of the way the *Octopus Deploy* team handles their issues :).
